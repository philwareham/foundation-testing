"Demo":http://foundation.philwareham.co.uk/.

Textpattern templates for use with "Zurb Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com, using their "LibSass and Grunt build stream":http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html.

h2. Requirements

Building this source repository requires:

* "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ >=0.10.0
* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0

Environment must consist of:

* Apache 2
* PHP >=5.3
* MySQL >=5
* Textpattern CMS 4.6.0-dev
* Unix-like OS, e.g. Linux or Mac OS

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP required by Textpattern. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ and "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/. You can install Node using the "installer":https://nodejs.org and Grunt with npm:

bc. $ npm install -g grunt-cli

Consult the Grunt documentation for more instructions if necessary. You might need to use @sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd textpattern-zurb-foundation
$ npm install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt and *bower* manages client-side scripts. You might need to use @sudo npm install@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems. The project will also require the normal git, Apache, MySQL and PHP in order to run Textpattern. All requirements must be added to your path variable.

h3. Installing Textpattern

Once you have Grunt installed, installing and updating Textpattern is easy. To setup or update Textpattern run:

bc. $ grunt setup

This will download the latest development version of Textpattern CMS and place it in the @public/@ directory. Complete the installation as usual by visiting the @/textpattern/setup@ interface and following the instructions therein. Further updates can be run with the same command, and are automatic.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @build@, @sass@, @setup@ or @watch@.

* The @build@ task builds the project.
* The @sass@ task builds just the CSS files of the project.
* The @setup@ task installs the latest build of Textpattern master branch from GitHub.
* The @watch@ task will launch a task that watches for file changes; the project is then automatically built if a source file is modified.

h2. Updating Foundation

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:

bc. $ npm update

h2. Updating Textpattern

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer build of Textpattern down the road just run:

bc. $ grunt setup
